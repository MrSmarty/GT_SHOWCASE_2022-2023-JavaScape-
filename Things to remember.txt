1. Failure is OK. I spend two hours trying and failing when figuring out how to make the things Asynchronous only to find that the solution was 5 lines of code.
2. 3D Printed Bracket:
    - Measured and Designed in Fusion 360
    - Was too small; Redesigned in Fusion 360
    - Broke in the printer and was still too small; Redesigned again
3. Multiple changes partway through to make everything more efficient
    - Switched from Swing UI to JavaFX 1/--/23
    - Switched from Threads to Virtual Threads 2/16/23
